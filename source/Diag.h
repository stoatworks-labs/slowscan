/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    This is deliberately a small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of
    the repos get a rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an
    FFGL effect gets only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- an effect is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it does cover is the failure that actually happens: `InitGL` returning
    `FF_FAIL` because a shader would not compile. From the operator's side that
    looks like "the effect does nothing", with no message anywhere. This plugin
    has two shader stages, so the log says *which* one, and the GL vendor and
    version strings sit next to it because that is almost always the reason.
