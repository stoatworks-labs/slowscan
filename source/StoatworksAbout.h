/*
 * Stoatworks Labs - About window data for slowscan.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL, and hand-written rather than generated. The fleet's copy of this
 * file is produced by stoatworks-backend/scripts/sync-about.py from the
 * website's projects.json, which is the one place these facts are written down
 * — but slowscan is not on the website yet, so there is nothing to generate from.
 * This is the shape the generator produces, filled in by hand, and it will be
 * overwritten by the first real sync. See AGENTS.md.
 *
 * `guide` is deliberately EMPTY: no user guide exists, and the About block
 * leaves a link out rather than showing a button that opens a 404. graticule
 * shipped the same way.
 *
 * `version` here is a fallback. The build injects the real one and overrides it.
